                    Mahatma Gandhi is an amazing example of leadership, personified with qualities which were unimaginable at that time. Among them, Patience, is the greatest lesson which an entrepreneur can extract from Bapu’s extraordinary story of freedom struggle. It is this patience which helped him overcome monstrous problems with an ease which is hard to even imagine. It was patience which actually made the mighty Britishers helpless against a person who was clad in a cotton cloth and mostly semi-naked. The very foundations of the British kingdom shook every time Mahatma Gandhi announced a new fast or a new rally, all without violence and without hurry

                     Sometimes, in our relationships, we become defensive, irritated, and say something to hurt others. We do not realize the importance of patience and end up making hasty decisions. Whenever you feel defensive against the person, try to be patient enough to take time to think over another person’s positive qualities.
