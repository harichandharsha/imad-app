                Building empathy towards others is very important if you want to live a hassle-free life. If you get irritated by a crying baby or a loud child playing in front of you, you must think about developing your patience. Patience helps you build empathy towards others.
                     Patience helps us accept other people as they are and makes us tolerant. By being impatient, you suffer more than other people

                If things are not going the way you want them to, instead of getting frustrated,  you must learn to be patient. You need to see things and situations in a positive light to make your life happier. And to get that positivity, you need to be patient.
                 If you find any life situation challenging, or find it difficult to bear, try to re-frame that situation and try to see its positive side.

                Anger and stress are two things that are enough to ruin a person’s health. And patience is the antidote to both these illnesses. Being patient, you can overcome any challenging situation with more flexibility and in a better way. Being stress-free and happy helps you stay healthier.
                 You can be patient if you have clear knowledge about your goal and if you are putting the desired effort in the right direction. There are many ways to achieve anything. The trick is to stick to your own plan when others around you seem to be getting ahead much faster than you. Yes, they may be enjoying more success than you, but you know nothing about where they are ultimately headed.
                    Patience is an important tool in overcoming frustration. Patience allows us to suspend judgment long enough to make informed decisions, thus paving the path to a happy and peaceful life.
                     Benjamin Franklin once said: “He that have patience can have what he will.” Having the ability to remain patient, will help you achieve big or better things in life. Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet. No one said life is going to be easy because all things are difficult before they become easy, but it will be your level of patience that will determine your fate.
